# IssuesTrack 😠🗯

## Issues Track is going to be an Application that will allow to record and keep on track for issues with customers.
## My Idea goes around the need of companies to organize the issues that cannot be addressed at the moment.
## For that reason IssuesTrack will provide an easy Interface to add and edit issues in a dashboard where the most important details of each scenario or problem will be visible.
## I will add user authentication so that each user can be able to log in and track and record their issues or be able to access global issues within the group.

## The tools I will be using to build this project include:

- HTML5
- CSS  
- JavaScript
- Typescript
- React
- Styled Components
- Redux
- Firebase
- 
### I will build the entire design of the project as well 👨‍💻

- Photoshop and MockFlow WireframePro for the design aspect



### Project in Construction👷‍♂️
